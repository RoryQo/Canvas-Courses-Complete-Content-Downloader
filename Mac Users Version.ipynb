    "# Automated Canvas Course Content Downloader\n",
    "\n",
    "This script downloads all course materials from both current and past Canvas courses using the Canvas API. It supports all file types, including `.pdf`, `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.csv`, `.ipynb`, and others. Files embedded inside pages, modules, or viewer-style links are automatically identified and downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this script, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Required Python Packages**  \n",
    "   Use pip to install the following packages:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `requests`  \n",
    "   - `beautifulsoup4`  \n",
    "   - `pdfkit`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install `wkhtmltopdf`**  \n",
    "   This tool is required by `pdfkit` to convert HTML content (pages, assignments, modules) into PDF files.  \n",
    "   - Download and install it from: [https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html)  \n",
    "   - Default path after installation will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate and Add Your Canvas API Token**  \n",
    "   - Log into Canvas, go to **Account > Settings > Approved Integrations**, and generate a new token.  \n",
    "   - Paste it into the script where indicated (`API_TOKEN = '...'`).\n",
    "   - Replace `pitt` in canvas domain with your institutions canvas domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the Script**  \n",
    "   Open the notebook or Python script and run it. It will:\n",
    "   - Retrieve both active and completed Canvas courses\n",
    "   - Download all available files, linked content, and assignment submissions\n",
    "   - Convert Canvas-hosted HTML content into PDFs (no `.html` files are saved)\n",
    "   - Save everything to a structured local folder organized by course\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "All downloaded files are saved to a local directory named `canvas_all_content`, with one subfolder per course. Original filenames and extensions are preserved\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folder Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "canvas_all_content/\n",
    "├── Course Name A/\n",
    "│   ├── lecture1.pdf\n",
    "│   ├── page - Syllabus.html\n",
    "│   ├── assignment - Essay.html\n",
    "│   ├── module - Week 1 Overview.html\n",
    "│   └── submission - final_essay.pdf\n",
    "├── Course Name B/\n",
    "│   └── ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most module and assignment PDFs may appear blank. This is expected behavior:\n",
    "  - Modules are often used as containers for linked content rather than standalone descriptions.\n",
    "  - Assignment pages are also frequently blank unless the instructor specifically writes assignment details in the Canvas page itself.\n",
    "  - These files are still processed because they often contain embedded links to downloadable materials."
